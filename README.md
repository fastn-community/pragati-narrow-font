# Pragati Narrow: FPM Font Package

This repository contains a [fpm font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Pragati Narrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pragati+Narrow/about?subset=devanagari).

Pragati Narrow is a libre Devanagari typeface family designed as a complement to [Archivo Narrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo%2BNarrow). It is a sans-serif family with vertical and horizontal cuts. Pragati Narrow comes in 2 weights (Regular and Bold) and was specially developed for screen as webfont and desktop font, too. The Devanagari was designed by Marcela Romero, Pablo Cosgaya and Nicol√°s Silva. The Latin version of Pragati is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. It includes four Narrow styles and four Normal styles (in development), was derived from Chivo (designed by H√©ctor Gatti) and was developed with the collaboration of the [Omnibus-Type](http://omnibus-type.com/) team.

Pragati (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ó‡§§‡§ø) is the Hindi word for ‚Äòprogress‚Äô.
